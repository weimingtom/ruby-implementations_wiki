* [verneuil](https://github.com/kschiess/verneuil) : Artificial Rubies. Using a fusion process.
* [Blue Ruby](http://wiki.sdn.sap.com/wiki/display/Research/BlueRuby) : An experimental runtime environment for the programming language Ruby that runs inside the ABAP Virtual Machine.
* [Ruby.NET](https://code.google.com/p/rubydotnetcompiler/) : (probably a dead project)
* [Smalltalk.rb](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/gnu-smalltalk.rb) : Translators to convert Ruby to Smalltalk, and various support tools to then run that code in on Smalltalk VM.
* [**MacRuby**](http://macruby.org/) : MacRuby is an implementation of Ruby 1.9 directly on top of Mac OS X core technologies such as the Objective-C runtime and garbage collector, the LLVM compiler infrastructure and the Foundation and ICU frameworks.
* [RubyGoLightly](https://github.com/feyeleanor/RubyGoLightly) : An experimental port of TinyRb to Google go, both as a means of learning go and exploring alternate approaches to implementing Ruby. Work is currently focused on the GoLightly VM.
* [**IronRuby**](http://www.ironruby.net/) : IronRuby is a Open Source implementation of the Ruby programming language for .NET and Silverlight, heavily relying on Microsoft's Dynamic Language Runtime.
* [**JRuby**](http://www.jruby.org/) : The Ruby Programming Language
on the JVM
* [XRuby](https://code.google.com/p/xruby/) : XRuby is the first Ruby to Java compiler which compiles Ruby source code (.rb) to Java bytecode (.class). The parser is implemented in ANTLR, and we use ASM to emit java bytecode. 
* [MetaRuby](http://zenspider.com/Languages/Ruby/MetaRuby.html) : Metaruby intends to implement ruby’s internals in ruby itself. Its implementation will use ruby2c to convert itself to C and bootstrap a new ruby binary. Metaruby should be fully compatible w/ Matz’s ruby.
* [_**Ruby MRI**_](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) : **Matz's Ruby Interpreter or Ruby MRI (also called CRuby) is the reference implementation of the Ruby programming language.**
* [ludicrous](http://rubystuff.org/ludicrous/) : Ludicrous is a just-in-time compiler for Ruby 1.8 and 1.9. Though still in the experimental stage, its performance is roughly on par with YARV (better in some benchmarks, though that may change as more features are added).
* [YARI](https://github.com/scottmuc/yari) : yari lets you install and switch between multiple versions of Ruby. Somewhat inspired by rvm and rbenv for unix like operating systems.
* [Fructose](https://github.com/charliesome/Fructose) : A Ruby-like language that compiles to PHP
* [REE](http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/) : Ruby Enterprise Edition
* [Carbone](http://www.nongnu.org/carbone/) : Carbone  is a  vmgen based,  efficient virtual  machine for  Ruby.  It
targets compatibility, performance and portability.
